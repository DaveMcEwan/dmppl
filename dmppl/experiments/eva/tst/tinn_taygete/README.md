Tinn on Taygete
===============

Only the non-proprietary pieces of code from Tinn on Taygete demonstration
system used in my PhD thesis.
Taygete is a commercial system from UltraSoC, and is not included here.
Either is the `udagent` tool connecting the USB device to a socket, or the
`py_link` stuff providing the Python API to that socket, or the many pieces of
Taygete-specific C code required to actually build binaries.
